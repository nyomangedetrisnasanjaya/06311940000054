# Data-Visualization-using-D3.js

In college, I gained substantial experience in data visualization, specifically utilizing D3.js for crafting dynamic and informative graphics. I successfully completed two significant projects, both of which involved visualizing data using dummy information as well as real-world datasets sourced from Kaggle.

1. [Number of Cooking Oil Sales in Indonesia by Brand](https://rawcdn.githack.com/nyomangedetrisnasanjaya/Data-Visualization-using-D3.js/105fde9999918185859745370a370c298cf279fa/Number%20of%20Cooking%20Oil%20Sales%20in%20Indonesia%20by%20Brand.html)

This project analyzes cooking oil sales in Indonesia, highlighting various brands. Utilizing dummy data, it provides valuable insights into market trends, brand performance, and consumer preferences. Notably, the analysis reveals that "Indomaret" emerges as the most favored cooking oil brand, boasting 45 sales. Conversely, "Filma" records a comparatively lower sales figure of 10, positioning it as the less preferred option. Through engaging visualizations, this project aims to provide a thorough understanding of the competitive landscape within the cooking oil industry in Indonesia.

2. [Average US Avocado Price in 2015 - 2018 by Type](https://rawcdn.githack.com/nyomangedetrisnasanjaya/Data-Visualization-using-D3.js/80f59633d59535b40d26e5b4c61a6927f780bd3e/Average%20Price%20of%20Avocado%20in%202015%20-%202018%20by%20Type.html)

This project delves into the dynamics of avocado average price across the years 2015 to 2018, leveraging data sourced from Kaggle's comprehensive [avocado price dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neuromusic/avocado-prices). Through detailed analysis, it provides valuable insights into the average price trends for different avocado types during this period. Remarkably, the findings reveal notable variations in pricing patterns. In 2015 and 2016, Avocado Code 4225 commanded the highest average price, while in 2017 and 2018, it was Avocado Type 4046. On the flip side, Avocado Type 4770 consistently records the lowest average price across the entire span of 2015 to 2018. This project aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the avocado market dynamics, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on robust data-driven insights.
